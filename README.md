Here are a few things I found useful in Deep Learning and/with Keras.

# Playground

1. [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org): Great tool to understand how all the pieces in a modern Deep Learning model training pipeline (like the one Keras enables) come together and to play with it on small datasets, all without writing any code.
    - The [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) from Google has many exercises that can be done with Playground. [Here is the link](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/playground-exercises) to exercises on Neural Networks.
2. [ConvNetJS](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) served as one of the inspirations for Tensorflow Playground and has a few demos of its own.
    - [toy 2d classification with 2-layer neural network](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html)
    - [CIFAR-10 demo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/cifar10.html) and [MNIST demo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/mnist.html)
3. [GAN Lab](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/) is just like Tensorflow Playground, but for GANs
4. [AI Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai) is a showcase of simple and fun applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. If you are looking for an idea for your next project, this could help.
5. [TensorFire](https://tenso.rs/) has [some](https://tenso.rs/demos/fast-neural-style/) [great](https://tenso.rs/demos/rock-paper-scissors/) [demos](https://cyborg.tenso.rs/).
6. For Neural Style Transfer, [Deepart](https://deepart.io/) has a [demo where you can create your own images](https://deepart.io/hire/) and a [gallery page](https://deepart.io/latest/) where you can see what others have created.
7. [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) is great for making Music and Art with Tensorflow. It has a [demo page](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos)
